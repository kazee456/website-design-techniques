// Question 3:
//Promises:. They allow you to schedule tasks that depend on the completion of other asynchronous operations.
//setTimeOut(), -They allow you to schedule the execution of a function after a specified delay.
// fetch(),- function is used to make network requests (e.g., HTTP requests) and returns a Promise 
//that resolves to the Response to that request.
//Async/Await: It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making it easier to manage asynchronous operations.
//setTimeout(callback, delay): This function schedules the execution of a callback function after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
